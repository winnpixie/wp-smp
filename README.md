# SMP-Core
Non-invasive/non-impactful gameplay additions.

Most/all of these are just me wanting features from Fabric / Forge mods in SpigotMC

# General
- [x] Bone meal cacti and sugar cane to accelerate growth
- [ ] Snowballs and eggs damage and/or cause knockback to players
- [x] Right click sign to change its text
- [ ] EXP share command (alt: right click air with an empty bottle to make a consumable EXP bottle)
- [ ] Sit command (MIGHT just get a plugin from spigotmc.org instead of making one...)
- [ ] Stacking potion effect times (ie. 2 minutes + 5 minutes = 7 minutes)

# Crafting
## Useful/Fun?
- [ ] Chainmail Armor
## Debatable?
- [ ] Nametags
- [ ] Bells

# Deconstructing/De-crafting
- [ ] 1x Wool -> 4x String + 1x Dye (if wool was dyed)

# Semi-reasonable/not necessary
- [ ] Command or action to see who a tamed mobs owner is
- [ ] Zombie horse natural spawn (not yet sure of what conditions should be met)
- [ ] Giant natural spawn (not sure of what conditions should be met)

# SHITPOST STATUS
- [ ] Chance for creepers to spawn charged
- [ ] Mobs explode on death (either just visual effect, or actual explosion, idk)
- [ ] Random dad joke on join ( https://icanhazdadjoke.com/ )
